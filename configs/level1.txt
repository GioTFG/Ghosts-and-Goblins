# This is an example of a well-formed config file for the game.
# It recreates the first part of the first official level of Ghost 'n Goblins.
# It is a sort of fusion between JSON and CSV.
# Every entry has its own line in the file, and is made of two parts: the option, and the value(s).
# Every option has a specific number and type of value that it can be assigned to.
# Some options allow multiple values. These MUST be introduced by an open square bracket and closed by its closed equivalent.
# The brackets must be used even if there's only one entry for the value.
# Lines starting with "#" and empty lines will be ignored.
